# ⚡ EV Charging Infrastructure Optimization

A Data-Driven Approach using XGBoost and MCDM

[Interactive Enhanced EV Heat Map](Enhanced_EV_Map.html)

## 📖 Project Overview

The rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is hindered by range anxiety and the lack of accessible charging infrastructure. This project aims to solve the Optimal Location Problem for EV charging stations using a machine learning pipeline.

By integrating diverse geospatial datasets (traffic volume, population density, commercial/residential POIs, and road networks), we predict charging demand at a granular level and rank locations using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) system.

## 🔑 Key Features

- Geospatial Feature Engineering: Aggregated OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, demographic stats, and traffic sensor logs.
- Predictive Modeling: Trained an XGBoost Regressor to predict localized energy demand scores (R² ≈ 0.88).
- Decision Support System: Implemented an MCDM layer to filter and rank the "Top 300" investment-ready sites.
- Interactive Reporting: Fully automated Quarto-based reporting with interactive geospatial visualizations.
